## 1.0.0

- Initial release

## 1.0.1

- Major revision to sue Crafty image instead of HA Alpine image. This makes build times much quicker, ensures always up to date version of Crafty and, importatly, allows Bedrock servers to run as these only work on Ubuntu bases. HA prefers Alpine, which does not work for Bedrock.

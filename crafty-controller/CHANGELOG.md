## 1.0.0

- Initial release

## 1.0.1

- Significant revision to use Crafty image instead of HA Alpine image. This makes build times much quicker, ensures always up to date version of Crafty and, importantly, allows Bedrock servers to run as these only work on Ubuntu bases. HA prefers Alpine, which does not work for Bedrock.

## 1.0.2

- Database backup and restore optimisation
